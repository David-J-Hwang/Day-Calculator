Great to hear that you've set up the basics! Now, let's move on to the next steps for your DayCalculator project. Here's a plan to guide you through the development of the core features:

### 1. Implement Date Calculation Logic

You'll need to write the JavaScript logic to calculate the differences between two dates in days, weeks, months, and years, as well as the D-day counting. This logic can be implemented in your `index.js` file inside the `public/js` folder.

- **Date Input**: Create a user interface in your `index.html` for users to input two dates. You can use HTML `<input type="date">` elements for this.
- **Calculation Functions**: Write functions in `index.js` to calculate the time difference between these dates in various units.
- **Event Listeners**: Set up event listeners for the buttons to trigger these calculations.

### 2. Enhance the User Interface

- **Styling**: Update your `index.css` to style the date input fields, buttons, and the area where the results will be displayed.
- **Results Display**: Design a section in your HTML where the results of the calculations will be shown to the user.

### 3. Set Up Express Routes for Different Calculations

In your `app.js`, set up different routes for each calculation type (`/days`, `/weeks`, `/months`, `/years`, `/d-day`). Initially, these can just render the same page, as the actual calculation will be done client-side in JavaScript.

### 4. Dynamic Content Loading (Optional)

If you want to make your application more dynamic, consider loading the content for each calculation type without reloading the entire page. This can be achieved using AJAX with vanilla JavaScript or by using a front-end framework/library like React or Vue.

### 5. Testing

- **Manual Testing**: Test all the features manually by entering different dates and ensuring the calculations are correct.
- **Responsive Design**: Check if your website is responsive and looks good on different devices.

### 6. Version Control and Deployment

- **Commit Changes**: Regularly commit your changes to Git, ensuring your commit messages are clear and descriptive.
- **Deployment**: Consider deploying your application to a cloud service like Heroku, AWS, or Vercel so it can be accessed online.

### 7. Documentation

- **Update README.md**: Document the features of your application, how to run it locally, and any other relevant information.

### 8. Future Enhancements

- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for user inputs.
- **Feature Expansion**: Think about additional features you might want to add, like timezone adjustments or including time in the calculations.

Remember, development is an iterative process. Start with basic functionality and gradually enhance both the features and the design. Test regularly to ensure everything works as expected. If you encounter any specific issues or need further guidance on any of these steps, feel free to ask!
